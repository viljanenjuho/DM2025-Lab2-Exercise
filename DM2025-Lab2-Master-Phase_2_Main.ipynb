      "*   **Clustering:** Grouping similar data points together without predefined classes (e.g., segmenting customers into different groups based on their purchasing behavior).\n",
      "*   **Association Rule Mining:** Discovering relationships between items in a dataset (e.g., \"customers who buy bread also tend to buy milk\"). This is often used in market basket analysis.\n",

      "\n",
      "### The Simple Definition\n",
      "\n",
      "At its core, **prompting is the act of giving instructions or asking a question to an Artificial Intelligence (AI)**, particularly a large language model (LLM) like ChatGPT, Google's Gemini, or Claude.\n",
      "\n",
      "Think of it like this: If the AI is a brilliant, incredibly knowledgeable, but very literal assistant, the **prompt** is the specific set of directions you give it to get the job done.\n",
      "\n",
      "A simple search on Google is a type of prompt, but with modern AI, prompting has become much more sophisticated.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### Why is Prompting So Important?\n",
      "\n",
      "The quality of the AI's output is directly tied to the quality of your prompt. This is often summarized by the old computing phrase: **\"Garbage in, garbage out.\"**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   A **vague prompt** will lead to a **vague or generic answer**.\n",
      "    *   *Example:* \"Write about cars.\"\n",
      "*   A **specific, well-crafted prompt** will lead to a **detailed, relevant, and useful answer**.\n",
      "    *   *Example:* \"Write a 300-word blog post comparing the fuel efficiency of the 2023 Honda Civic and the 2023 Toyota Corolla for a first-time car buyer.\"\n",

      "---\n",

      "### The Key Components of a Good Prompt\n",
      "\n",
      "A good prompt often includes several key elements to guide the AI effectively. While you don't always need all of them, using them will dramatically improve your results.\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Role / Persona:** Tell the AI *who* it should be. This sets the tone, style, and expertise level.\n",
      "    *   *Examples:* \"Act as an expert copywriter,\" \"You are a friendly and encouraging fitness coach,\" \"Pretend you are a travel guide for Paris.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "2.  **Task / Instruction:** State clearly what you want the AI to *do*. Use strong action verbs.\n",
      "    *   *Examples:* \"Write,\" \"Summarize,\" \"Translate,\" \"Generate a list,\" \"Compare and contrast,\" \"Explain this concept in simple terms.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "3.  **Context / Background:** Provide the necessary information the AI needs to understand the request fully. This is the \"who, what, where, when, why.\"\n",
      "    *   *Examples:* \"I am preparing for a job interview for a marketing manager position,\" \"The target audience for this email is busy executives,\" \"Here is the article I want you to summarize: [text].\"\n",
      "\n",
      "4.  **Format / Constraints:** Specify *how* you want the output to be structured.\n",
      "    *   *Examples:* \"Provide the answer in a bulleted list,\" \"Write in a professional but friendly tone,\" \"The response should be no more than 200 words,\" \"Format the output as a JSON object.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "### Example: From Bad Prompt to Good Prompt\n",
      "\n",
      "Let's see how these components transform a request.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Bad Prompt:**\n",
      "> \"Give me some marketing ideas.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "*This is too vague. The AI has no idea what your business is, who your customers are, or what kind of ideas you need.*\n",
      "\n",
      "**Good Prompt:**\n",
      "> **(Role)** \"Act as a senior marketing strategist specializing in e-commerce.\n",
      ">\n",
      "> **(Context)** I run a small online store that sells handmade, eco-friendly candles. My target audience is environmentally conscious millennials aged 25-40. My budget for this campaign is small, around $500.\n",
      ">\n",
      "> **(Task)** Generate a list of 5 creative, low-cost marketing ideas to increase online sales for the upcoming holiday season.\n",
      ">\n",
      "> **(Format)** For each idea, provide a brief description and an estimated cost. Present the final output in a numbered list.\"\n",

      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### Types of Prompting Techniques\n",
      "\n",
      "As people have gotten better at interacting with AI, several techniques have emerged:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Zero-Shot Prompting:** This is the most basic form. You ask the AI to do something it hasn't been explicitly trained on with an example. The \"Good Prompt\" above is a zero-shot prompt.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Few-Shot Prompting:** You provide a few examples of what you want before you ask the final question. This helps the AI understand the pattern, style, or format you're looking for.\n",
      "    *   *Example:*\n",
      "        > \"Summarize customer feedback into a single sentence.\n",
      "        >\n",
      "        > **Feedback:** 'The shipping was incredibly fast, and the product quality exceeded my expectations!'\n",
      "        > **Summary:** Positive feedback on shipping speed and product quality.\n",
      "        >\n",
      "        > **Feedback:** 'I had to wait two weeks for my order, and when it arrived, the box was damaged.'\n",
      "        > **Summary:** Negative feedback on slow shipping and damaged packaging.\n",
      "        >\n",
      "        > **Feedback:** 'The website was easy to use, and I loved the variety of colors available for the product.'\n",
      "        > **Summary:** [AI completes this part]\"\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Prompting:** For complex problems, you can ask the AI to \"think step-by-step.\" This forces it to break down its reasoning process, which often leads to more accurate results, especially for math or logic puzzles.\n",
      "    *   *Example:* \"If a train leaves Station A at 3 PM traveling at 60 mph, and Station B is 150 miles away, what time will it arrive? **Show your reasoning step-by-step.**\"\n",
      "\n",
      "### What is Prompt Engineering?\n",
      "\n",
      "**Prompt Engineering** is the discipline of designing, refining, and optimizing prompts to get the best possible output from an AI. It's a skill that involves creativity, logic, and iterative testing. As AI becomes more integrated into our lives and work, prompt engineering is becoming a valuable and even professional skill.\n",

      "Large Language Models (LLMs) \n",
      "\n",
      "\t Definition \n",
      "\n",
      "\t\t Large Language Models (LLMs) are a type of artificial intelligence model that are trained on massive amounts of text data. They are designed to understand, generate, and manipulate human language. LLMs are characterized by their enormous size (billions or trillions of parameters) and their ability to perform a wide variety of natural language processing tasks. \n",
      "\n",
      "\t Capabilities \n",
      "\n",
      "\t\t LLMs can perform tasks such as text generation, translation, summarization, question answering, code generation, and creative writing. They learn complex linguistic patterns, grammar, facts, and reasoning abilities from their training data. \n",
      "\n",
      "\t Underlying Technology \n",
      "\n",
      "\t\t LLMs are typically built using deep learning architectures, most notably the Transformer architecture, which allows them to process sequential data like text very effectively. \n",
      "\n",
      "Relationship Between Machine Learning, Data Centers, and LLMs \n",
      "\n",
      "\t LLMs as a Product of Machine Learning \n",
      "\n",
      "\t\t LLMs are a sophisticated application and outcome of machine learning research and development. The techniques used to train LLMs, such as deep learning and neural networks, are core machine learning concepts. Therefore, LLMs are a specific, advanced type of machine learning model. \n",
      "\n",
      "\t Data Centers as the Foundation for LLMs and ML \n",
      "\n",
      "\t\t Training and running LLMs, as well as many other complex machine learning models, requires immense computational power and vast amounts of data storage. Data centers provide the necessary infrastructure – high-performance servers, specialized hardware (like GPUs and TPUs), robust networking, and reliable power – to handle these computationally intensive tasks. Without data centers, it would be practically impossible to develop, train, and deploy LLMs at scale. \n",
      "\n",
      "\t Interdependence \n",
      "\n",
      "\t\t In essence, machine learning is the field of study and the set of techniques. LLMs are a powerful manifestation of these techniques. Data centers are the physical environments and infrastructure that enable the training, deployment, and operation of both general machine learning models and highly demanding LLMs. LLMs rely on ML principles, and both ML and LLMs rely heavily on the resources provided by data centers. \n",

       " 'text': '**Page 1**\\n\"\"\"\\nDan Baldwin\\nGroup 4\\nAuteur Review - Interstellar \\nI believe Christopher Nolan: the director behind the 2014 sci-ﬁ/adventure cinematic ‘Interstellar,’ \\nto be a very intellectual and imaginative inventive talent.  \\nHis style in his previous ﬁlms sets characters in epic unique locations, with gargantuan issues to \\nface, and artistically impresses the audience with how the characters solve their problems. For \\nexample, in Nolan’s 2010 ﬁlm ‘Inception,’ he tackles the idea of dreams, and sets his characters \\ndiving through dreams within dreams within even more dreams to complete their goals. Because \\nthis idea is so farfetched, and dreams are a subject in which science has made little factual \\ndiscovery in, Nolan is free to use his creativity to present ideas such as landscapes folding in on \\nthemselves and corridors spinning, without seeming unrealistic. \\nThis brain-racking epic theme is once again evident in ‘Interstellar,’ as Nolan sets his characters \\nduring a second American dust bowl on future Earth. The world is short of food, and will soon be \\nuninhabitable. So, ex-NASA pilot ‘Cooper’ (Matthew McConaughey) is summoned back to space \\ntravel in a bid to ﬁnd a new planet for the species to inhabit. Luckily for Cooper and his team, a \\nblack hole orbiting Saturn can transport them further into space to land on these potential \\nplanets. \\nThroughout the ﬂick, the crew explore multiple worlds - again feeding Nolan’s mind more \\nopportunities to create crazy scenarios. For example, one planet that Cooper and his friends, \\n‘Brand,’ (Anne Hathaway) and ‘Romilly,’ (David Gyasi) visit initially seems like an inﬁnite sea of two \\nfeet deep water. Not threatening at all right? Well think again, because the crew suddenly ﬁnd out \\nthat a giant 100ft tidal wave is about to hit them, and they have minutes to ﬂy away. Nolan further \\nincreases the stakes in this scene as it is explained that every hour spent on this planet counts for \\nseven years on earth, meaning the planet will be destroyed before they return if their ship sinks. \\nAt the climax of the ﬁlm, the crew end up sending themselves through a black hole into a \\ntesseract (a 3D representation of a larger dimension) to ﬁnd the ‘secret to harnessing gravity’ \\nwhich will let the human race bend space-time in order to survive oﬀ earth. I know. Mental. \\nThe imagination that Nolan possesses and implicates into ‘Interstellar’ is farfetched and \\nwonderful, not only impressing his audience with the appealing visuals he creates, but induces \\nthem to think and discuss what is going on due its scientiﬁc depth. Personally, as someone who is \\nbamboozled by the idea of how big the universe is, I ﬁnd it unendingly entertaining to repeatedly \\nwatch this ﬁlm and understanding it more each time, and can only hope the technology portrayed \\nwill one day come true. \\nOverall, ‘Interstellar’ is a clear example of Nolan’s auteur talent, as he once again ﬁgments yet \\nanother cluster of conditions for us to marvel at.

More speciﬁcally, the bleak period of the Nanjing Massacre during the\\nSecond Sino-Japanese War in 1937. But instead of recounting the true events through the eyes of a\\nsoldier, Shen Ao sets his sights on how the Chinese civilians play their signiﬁcant parts in turning\\nthings around.\\nAmong them is A Chang (Liu Haoran), a postal worker who ﬁnds himself caught in the middle of\\nthe war as the Imperial Japanese army invades Nanjing. His life is spared from execution after he\\ndecides to pretend to be a photo technician. The reason? One of the high-ranking Japanese\\noﬃcers, Hideo Ito (Daichi Harashima), happens to be the photographer responsible for taking\\nselective pictures for propaganda purposes. And coincidentally, he lacks the practical knowledge of\\ndeveloping ﬁlms, making A Chang an important person to help him do so.\\nThe latter, who claims to be an employee working at the Jixiang Photo Studio, has to improvise on\\nhis part to avoid suspicion. Thankfully, he’s a quick learner, thanks to the guidance of the photo\\nstudio owner Jin Chengzong (Wang Xiao), who’s been hiding underneath with his family. Upon\\ndeveloping the photos in the dark room, they uncover images of horrifying details, including rape\\nand war violence caused by the cruelty of the Japanese army. But such photos of atrocities cannot\\nbe released at all costs, and despite the strict orders coming from Ito’s superiors, they manage to\\nﬁnd ways to secretly copy these images to be used as photographic evidence someday.\\nShen Ao relies heavily on the power of suggestion associated with the Nanjing Massacre. Rapes are\\nimplied, while the violence against the Chinese soldiers and civilians is mostly depicted in a\\nrestrained manner. Viewers still get to witness the graphic horrors of a mass execution, and at one\\npoint, an uncomfortable scene revolving around an infant child. Here, Ao’s matter-of-fact, yet\\nclinical direction portrays these moments of monstrosity with none of the gratuitous or\\nexploitative visual style.\\nA war movie like this tends to get jingoistic to appease the Chinese censors, and while Dead to\\nRights can’t escape from such an obligatory inclusion, kudos to Ao for not overwhelming it to the\\npoint of ad nauseam. The movie is consistently engaging with all the emotional and dramatic\\nresonance intact, as ordinary citizens like A Chang’s selﬂess sacriﬁce in helping others in need,\\nwhile maintaining his composure when it comes to dealing with Ito.\\nWhile Haoran deserves credit for his earnest portrayal as A Chang, it was Daichi Harashima who\\nexcels the most as Hideo Ito. Beneath his seemingly lesser-evil portrayal of a Japanese oﬃcer and\\nphotographer, who claims he and A Chang are friends, lies a cloak of malevolence hidden deep\\nwithin his facade. His gradual descent to unveiling his true colours is unnerving, but he does so\\nwithout falling prey to chewing the scenery.\\nThe movie also beneﬁts from strong supporting roles, notably Wang Chuan-Jun as Wang Guanghai,\\nwhose vital translation skills give him the leverage of making a deal with the Japanese. But beyond\\nhis opportunistic trait, which seems to care for his own survival and his loved ones, he still sided\\nwith his fellow citizens on some occasions.\\nTechnically speaking, Dead to Rights excels in its atmospheric cinematography along with the\\nevocative sound design and Ao’s astute sense of buildup tension. The latter is especially true with\\nthe elaborate sequence revolving around the all-important passes to cross over the border safely.\\nAo is equally adept at blending stark metaphors, like how a camera can be as important as a riﬂe\\nduring the latter part of the movie. Whereas the riﬂe is mainly used as a threat and an execution\\nfor killing a person, the camera represents the contrasting weaponisation of a tool to capture and\\nexpose one’s hideous act to the world.\\nDiscover more\\nOnline movie streaming services\\nNo More Bets\\nNanjing\\n南京照相馆\\nDead to Rights\\nQueer\\nSicario\\nEvil Dead Rise (2023\\nValley of the Shadow of Death\\n\"\"\"\\n\\n',\n",

    "The extracted information is generally good, but I believe it can be improved by using more advanced LangExtract options that I did not initially utilize. Specifically, I could improve quality by adding few-shot examples to show the model what qualifies as a strong opinion segment. I could also adjust overlap settings to avoid redundant or fragmented extractions and enable confidence scores to filter out weak or low-certainty results. Furthermore, I could customize the schema with clearer attribute definitions to guide the model toward richer sentiment understanding or more precise subject identification. Implementing these options would help me capture more nuanced opinions and reduce noise in the extracted output."

    "\n",
    "Their key advantages are:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Contextual Understanding:** Unlike older methods, LLM embeddings are contextual. The vector for a word like **\"bank\"** will be different depending on whether it's used in the context of a \"river bank\" or a \"money bank,\" providing a more nuanced representation of language.\n",
    "\n",

    "The 3D UMAP projection presents the same general structure as the 2D plot, but the additional dimension allows the emotion clusters to separate more clearly. I noticed that in 2D, some emotion groups, especially anger and fear, appear more overlapped because the reduction compresses the information into a flat plane. In 3D, I observed that these same clusters spread out along the extra axis, making boundaries and internal groupings easier to distinguish when I rotated the plot. However, I found that while 3D provides better spatial separation, it is also harder to interpret at a glance, whereas the 2D projection remains more visually readable despite showing slightly more overlap."

    "RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) is a technique where a language model combines document retrieval with text generation. In RAG, a retrieval system first finds relevant documents or text chunks, and then the language model uses this retrieved information to generate a more informed and accurate response. This method enhances the model's ability to answer questions by grounding its responses in real, external data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following code, we will load a webpage as a document, which allows us to retrieve text from a URL. After loading the content, we will split the document into smaller, manageable chunks, making it easier for our model to process. Then, we'll generate embeddings for these chunks with a specified LLM model (Gemini Embedding Model). These embeddings will be stored in a vector database, which enables us to perform similarity searches. By setting up this retrieval system, we can use a RAG chain to answer questions. The retriever finds relevant text chunks from the document based on a query, and the LLM generates a response by incorporating this retrieved information, making the answers more grounded and accurate.\n",

    "Few-shot prompting is a technique where a Large Language Model (LLM) is given a small number of labeled examples within a prompt to guide its classification. This allows the model to perform a new task with minimal data, avoiding the need for extensive fine-tuning.\n",

    "*   **1-shot:** The model is given one example for each emotion before classifying.\n",

    "To make our implementation robust and efficient, we are incorporating two key features:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Structured Output:** We provide the Gemini model with a specific output schema (`Emotions` class). This instructs the model to return *only* a valid emotion label (e.g., `joy`), which makes the output predictable and reliable, minimizing errors.\n",
    "2.  **API Rate Handling:** The code includes a function to manage the requests-per-minute limit of the Gemini API.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will test the model's performance on a small sample of 20 texts per emotion to ensure the process runs quickly. If the model provides an invalid response, the code will automatically retry the request until a valid classification is received.\n",

    "I observed that performance improved predictably as I provided more examples. Zero-shot prompting proved to be the weakest method, achieving 50% accuracy. Without guidance, the model often confused distinct emotions like joy and sadness. I found that adding just a single example in the one-shot approach increased accuracy to 55% and balanced the error distribution. Five-shot prompting yielded the best results at approximately 57%. Although this was not a drastic improvement over the one-shot strategy, I concluded that the additional examples helped the model refine its understanding and minimize errors."

    "The results showed that adding few-shot examples did not always improve the model's performance. I found that many texts remained consistently misclassified across all shot levels, especially those with ambiguous emotional cues, sarcasm, or mixed sentiments. These cases appeared in the \"Always Wrong\" group and indicated that some inputs are simply too subtle or noisy for the model to classify reliably, regardless of the number of examples I provided.\n",
    "\n",
    "I also noted cases where performance deteriorated when I added more examples. This typically occurred when the few-shot examples unintentionally biased the model toward certain emotions, most notably overpredicting joy or sadness. As a result, some predictions that were correct in the zero-shot setting became incorrect in the five-shot setting. This demonstrates that few-shot prompting can sometimes introduce overfitting to the example patterns, reducing generalization instead of improving it."

    "- **Advanced topic - QLoRA (Quantized Low-Rank Adapter):** QLoRA is a method used to make fine-tuning large language models more efficient. It works by adding a small, trainable part (LoRA) to a pre-trained model, while keeping the rest of the model frozen. At the same time, it reduces the size of the model’s data using a process called quantization, which makes the model require less memory. This allows you to fine-tune large models without needing as much computational power, making it easier to adapt models for specific tasks.
