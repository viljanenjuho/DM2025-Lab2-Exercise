2025\nCasey\nShen Ao’s much-anticipated follow-up to No More Bets sees the co-writer and director going back\nin time in Dead to Rights. More speciﬁcally, the bleak period of the Nanjing Massacre during the\nSecond Sino-Japanese War in 1937. But instead of recounting the true events through the eyes of a\nsoldier, Shen Ao sets his sights on how the Chinese civilians play their signiﬁcant parts in turning\nthings around.\nAmong them is A Chang (Liu Haoran), a postal worker who ﬁnds himself caught in the middle of\nthe war as the Imperial Japanese army invades Nanjing. His life is spared from execution after he\ndecides to pretend to be a photo technician. The reason? One of the high-ranking Japanese\noﬃcers, Hideo Ito (Daichi Harashima), happens to be the photographer responsible for taking\nselective pictures for propaganda purposes. And coincidentally, he lacks the practical knowledge of\ndeveloping ﬁlms, making A Chang an important person to help him do so.\nThe latter, who claims to be an employee working at the Jixiang Photo Studio, has to improvise on\nhis part to avoid suspicion. Thankfully, he’s a quick learner, thanks to the guidance of the photo\nstudio owner Jin Chengzong (Wang Xiao), who’s been hiding underneath with his family. Upon\ndeveloping the photos in the dark room, they uncover images of horrifying details, including rape\nand war violence caused by the cruelty of the Japanese army. But such photos of atrocities cannot\nbe released at all costs, and despite the strict orders coming from Ito’s superiors, they manage to\nﬁnd ways to secretly copy these images to be used as photographic evidence someday.\nShen Ao relies heavily on the power of suggestion associated with the Nanjing Massacre. Rapes are\nimplied, while the violence against the Chinese soldiers and civilians is mostly depicted in a\nrestrained manner. Viewers still get to witness the graphic horrors of a mass execution, and at one\npoint, an uncomfortable scene revolving around an infant child. Here, Ao’s matter-of-fact, yet\nclinical direction portrays these moments of monstrosity with none of the gratuitous or\nexploitative visual style.\nA war movie like this tends to get jingoistic to appease the Chinese censors, and while Dead to\nRights can’t escape from such an obligatory inclusion, kudos to Ao for not overwhelming it to the\npoint of ad nauseam. The movie is consistently engaging with all the emotional and dramatic\nresonance intact, as ordinary citizens like A Chang’s selﬂess sacriﬁce in helping others in need,\nwhile maintaining his composure when it comes to dealing with Ito.\nWhile Haoran deserves credit for his earnest portrayal as A Chang, it was Daichi Harashima who\nexcels the most as Hideo Ito. Beneath his seemingly lesser-evil portrayal of a Japanese oﬃcer and\nphotographer, who claims he and A Chang are friends, lies a cloak of malevolence hidden deep\nwithin his facade. His gradual descent to unveiling his true colours is unnerving, but he does so\nwithout falling prey to chewing the scenery.\nThe movie also beneﬁts from strong supporting roles, notably Wang Chuan-Jun as Wang Guanghai,\nwhose vital translation skills give him the leverage of making a deal with the Japanese. But beyond\nhis opportunistic trait, which seems to care for his own survival and his loved ones, he still sided\nwith his fellow citizens on some occasions.\nTechnically speaking, Dead to Rights excels in its atmospheric cinematography along with the\nevocative sound design and Ao’s astute sense of buildup tension. The latter is especially true with\nthe elaborate sequence revolving around the all-important passes to cross over the border safely.\nAo is equally adept at blending stark metaphors, like how a camera can be as important as a riﬂe\nduring the latter part of the movie. Whereas the riﬂe is mainly used as a threat and an execution\nfor killing a person, the camera represents the contrasting weaponisation of a tool to capture and\nexpose one’s hideous act to the world.\nDiscover more\nOnline movie streaming services\nNo More Bets\nNanjing\n南京照相馆\nDead to Rights\nQueer\nSicario\nEvil Dead Rise (2023\nValley of the Shadow of Death\n\"\"\"\n\n", "document_id": "doc_a6f0f727"}
