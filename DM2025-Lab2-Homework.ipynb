The `first two phases` refer to the `exercises inside the Master notebooks` of the [DM2025-Lab2-Exercise Repo](https://github.com/difersalest/DM2025-Lab2-Exercise.git). The `third phase` refers to an `internal Kaggle competition` that we are gonna run among all the Data Mining students. Together they add up to `100 points` of your grade. There are also some `bonus points` to be gained if you complete `extra exercises` in the lab **(bonus 15 pts)** and in the `Kaggle Competition report` **(bonus 5 pts)**.\n",

    "- **Phase 2 exercises:** We use Gemini's API so everything can be run with only CPU without a problem.\n",
    "- **Phase 3 exercises:** For the competition you will probably need GPU to train your models, so it is recommended to use Colab or Kaggle if you don't have a laptop with a dedicated GPU.\n",

    "### 1.1 Preprocessing Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "I focused the preprocessing phase on preparing noisy, user-generated text for downstream modeling. Because the dataset originated from informal social media posts, it contained emojis, inconsistent punctuation, hashtags, and colloquial expressions. For transformer-based models, I applied minimal preprocessing to preserve these emotionally relevant cues. I only removed URLs, malformed unicode, and redundant whitespace. This approach aligns with modern research indicating that large language models rely on full textual context, including punctuation and emotive symbols, to capture sentiment. I also constructed a secondary \"cleaned\" version of the text for classical ML models involving lowercasing, whitespace normalization, and the removal of extraneous characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "I reconstructed the dataset by combining raw text from JSON files, split identifiers, and emotion labels. Once these were merged into training and testing sets, we analyzed the distribution and found a significant class imbalance. The \"joy\" category was dominant, containing nearly twenty times as many examples as the \"disgust\" category. This disparity proved to be a central factor in the model's performance later on.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2 Feature Engineering Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "I adapted my feature engineering techniques to fit the specific modeling strategy. For the classical machine-learning models, I employed TF-IDF vectorization to convert text into numerical representations. I used unigrams and bigrams to capture both individual tokens and short contextual patterns. Additionally, I used sublinear term weighting and a high-capacity vocabulary to retain expressive detail. These engineered features allowed linear models like Support Vector Machines to establish a strong baseline.\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, for the transformer-based architectures (DistilBERT, RoBERTa, and DeBERTa), I relied primarily on the learned contextual embeddings produced by their own tokenizers. I added no handcrafted features to these models because the deep contextual representations generated by their attention mechanisms serve as effective end-to-end feature extractors.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.3 Explanation of Your Model\n",
    "\n",
    "I selected DeBERTa-v3-Large as the final model for this project. Developed by Microsoft, this state-of-the-art architecture improves upon previous models like BERT and RoBERTa by separating content and positional embeddings. These design choices allow the model to better understand subtle emotional signals, including punctuation patterns, emojis, and the informal phrasing common in social media text. Given that emotion detection requires interpreting these nuanced cues, I found that DeBERTa-v3-Large provided a significantly more capable representation than smaller architectures.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before fine-tuning, I addressed the severe class imbalance in the dataset which initially limited performance for minority emotions like disgust and fear. I oversampled the training data to ensure that each emotion class had an approximately equal number of examples. After balancing the dataset, I fine-tuned the model on the emotion classification task. The combination of the model's large capacity and the balanced data allowed it to learn richer patterns and achieve stronger generalization across all emotion classes.\n",

    "\n",
    "## 2. Bonus Section (5 pts Optional)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.1 Mention Different Things You Tried\n",
    "\n",
    "I explored several strategies to address poor performance in the minority classes, including probability-threshold optimization, data augmentation using back-translation and synonyms, and training multiple transformer variants. Threshold optimization resulted in negligible gains, suggesting that the underlying class separability was insufficient. I eventually abandoned data augmentation due to runtime constraints and implementation issues. Ultimately, I found that oversampling the minority classes before training produced the most practical and reliable improvement. I also compared DistilBERT, RoBERTa-base, and DeBERTa-v3. Although DistilBERT and RoBERTa underperformed due to the imbalance, DeBERTa-v3 demonstrated the best capacity once I corrected the class frequencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.2 Mention Insights You Gained\n",
    "\n",
    "My main insight from this project was that data quality and class balance can dominate model performance, even when using advanced architectures. I learned that transformers are not inherently robust to extreme imbalance. Without sufficient representation for each class, they tended to predict the majority class, which inflated weighted metrics while suppressing macro-level performance. Additionally, I found that minimal text cleaning was essential for transformer models because removing punctuation or emojis degraded their ability to capture emotional nuance. I also observed that simpler models, such as TF-IDF with SVM, could outperform advanced models when the dataset was imbalanced. However, once I balanced the dataset, the transformers exhibited markedly superior performance and generalization.\n",
